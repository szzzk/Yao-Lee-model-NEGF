# Yao-Lee-model-NEGF
The code used in paper arXiv:2104.12887

This code is written in Matlab language.
Yao_Lee_model_periodic.m calculates the Green's functions selfconsistently, with periodic boundary condition in y diredction.
YLselfE.m generates the first-order self energy, which can later be used in YL_firstorder_tranmission.m to calculate the spin current with Meir-Wingreen formula.
